# We-connect
Product Description:

We-Connect is an integrated interface that allows recruiters to conduct remote interviews while interviewees display their skills more efficiently.
It's a web-based video conferencing tool that may be used for one-on-one video calls, group video calls, or conducting interviews with collaborative capabilities such as Notepad and whiteboard. Mute audio/video and a built-in chat window are included in the video call.
The future version of this application will also include features like online compiler and profile sharing options for various coding platforms.

## Tech stack used:

### Front End:
- HTML5(hypertext markup language) 
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 
- Node.js(open source, a server-side script) 
- Socket.IO 
- WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that allows Web apps and sites to record and selectively broadcast audio and/or video material, as well as transmit arbitrary data between browsers without the need for an intermediary.
  WebRTC makes it simple to establish peer-to-peer connections with other web browsers. To create such an app from the ground up, you'd need a slew of frameworks and tools to cope with concerns like data loss, connection loss and so on. WebRTC has a number of interconnected APIs and protocols that work together to achieve this goal. There are no plugins or third-party software requirements for this technology. 
- Peer.Js :- WebRTC framework which abstracts and simplifies peer to peer connection API.
- CKEditor5 :- It's an API made using modern JavaScript to incorporate a text editor in our application.
